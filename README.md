![ic_launcher](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b79cdcd-f840-47b2-b05a-b1c553425fe2)


A mod for Plants vs. Zombies 1 that restores the original experience by removing ads and reverting EA's intrusive changes. Relive the glory of PopCap's original masterpiece without the distractions and limitations introduced in later versions.

# Features

**No Ads**
- Automatic popup ads have been removed, you won't see a single ad anywhere while playing.
- Banner ads have also been removed
- You do not get asked to watch an ad for more lawnmowers, an extra seed slot, a garden rake, etc...

**Old but Gold**
- Based on the old delisted paid version of the original PvZ
  - This fixes an issue on many devices where the performance would severely decrease after the first few levels
  - Better version to base off
  
**No annoying features**

Various other annoying features from the latest free version aren't present here, such as:
- Increased gargantuan walk and swing speed
- Minigames do not cost money (you can buy them legit)
- No [fullscreen ads](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantsVSZombies/comments/1h29a9m/popcap_you_cant_be_serious/)
- No issue where [some lawnmowers are gone](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantsVSZombies/comments/1grb5q9/is_anyone_else_having_this_happen_to_them_on_pvz1/)
- No popup ads for [EA's other games](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantsVSZombies/comments/1ggk0ng/am_i_seriously_downloading_a_golfing_game_just_to/)

## Why Pokey's PvZ?

![Background3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75451068-5253-4173-aa24-a02f756ea835)


When EA acquired PopCap, they pushed changes that were not well received by fans, started becoming more greedy and later delisted the paid version, forcing everybody to use their buggy, ad-riddled joke of a version with horrible features. My mod fixes all of these and grants you the PvZ 1 experience you deserve.

# Installation
- Download the latest version of the APK and OBB files from the Releases page
- Install the APK
  - If you get a Play Protect warning, scan the app and let it install.
- Place the obb file under `Android/obb/com.pokey8680.pvz`
  - If the folder isn't there, you can create it.

# To Be Fixed
- Music
  - The horde music doesn't play.
  - Some tracks do not loop properly
- FPS Cap
  - The game is capped at 30fps, making it not as smooth as the PC or console versions, which play at 60+ fps.
- Zombies On Your Lawn 
  - *Zombies On Your Lawn* does not play after you beat Dr. Zomboss.
- Imitater 
  - Plants made by the Imitater do not become gray
- Misc
  - Users with more modern phones may find rounded corners getting cut off

  # Suspicions
- This app is not a trojan or a virus. It's why I put this project on GitHub, so that you all can see the source code and everything that goes into this version.
