# Features

  - This fixes an issue on many devices where the performance would severely decrease after the first few levels

## Why Pokey's PvZ?

When EA acquired PopCap, they pushed changes that were not well received by fans, started becoming more greedy and later delisted the paid version, forcing everybody to use their buggy, ad-riddled joke of a version with horrible features. My mod fixes all of these and grants you the PvZ 1 experience you deserve.

# Installation
- Download the latest version of the APK and OBB files from the Releases page
- Install the APK
- Place the obb file under `Android/obb/com.pokey8680.pvz`
  - If the folder isn't there, you can create it.

# To Be Fixed
- Horde music 
  - The horde music doesn't play.
- FPS Cap
  - The game is capped at 30fps, making it not as smooth as the PC or console versions, which play at 60+ fps.
